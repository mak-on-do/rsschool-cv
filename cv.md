### About me
I am 42. At the age of 41, I started studying the layout of websites in my free time. I have completed several commercial projects on a freelance basis and realized that I need to systematize my knowledge and fill in the gaps in order to become a qualified and in-demand specialist. To do this, I signed up for a JavaScript/Front-end course at RS School.
### Skills
* HTML5
* CSS3 (SASS/SCSS)
* JavaScript (basics)
* jQuery
* BEM
* Gulp
* Git
* English - A1
### Code
There is my solution kata from CodeWars.
```
function yourFutureCareer() {
  let career = Math.random();
    if (career <= 0.32) {
      return "FrontEnd Developer";
     } else if (career <= 0.65) {
      return "BackEnd Developer";
    } else {
      return 'Full-Stack Developer';
    }
}
```
